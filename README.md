# Python Data Analysis and Visualization Exercises

This project involves solving exercises to enhance skills in data manipulation, numerical computations, and data visualization using Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**. The exercises focus on various matrix operations, plotting techniques, and processing datasets like "cars_data".

## Features

### 1. NumPy Exercises
- Create and reshape arrays.
- Perform matrix computations:
  - Element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
  - Matrix multiplication using the `@` operator.
- Calculate matrix statistics:
  - Minimum, maximum, mean, median, and sum across rows and columns.
  - Index of minimum/maximum elements in the matrix.
- Demonstrate vector transformations and norms.

### 2. Matplotlib Exercises
- Explore two plotting styles in Matplotlib:
  - Object-oriented style (recommended).
  - Pyplot style (simple interface).
- Plot mathematical functions like:
  - Linear, quadratic, and cubic functions.
  - Customized sine wave.
- Use scatter plots, bar charts, and more.
- Understand the roles of figures, axes, axis, and artists in Matplotlib.

### 3. Pandas Exercises
- Load and process the `cars_data.csv` dataset:
  - Display the first and last rows of the dataset.
  - Identify missing values and clean the dataset by dropping rows with missing data.
- Use methods like `.info()`, `.head()`, `.tail()` to explore data.
- Perform basic data transformations and checks for null values.
